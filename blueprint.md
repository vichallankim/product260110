# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

A simple, visually appealing web application to generate random lottery numbers.

## Project Outline

*   **`index.html`**: Contains the structure of the web page, including a title, a button to trigger the number generation, and a container to display the results.
*   **`style.css`**: Provides the styling for the application, ensuring a clean and modern look and feel.
*   **`main.js`**: Holds the logic for generating the random lottery numbers and updating the UI.

## Current Plan

1.  **Create the user interface** in `index.html`.
2.  **Style the UI** in `style.css` for a better user experience.
3.  **Implement the number generation logic** in `main.js`.
